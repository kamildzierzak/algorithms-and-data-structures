# Week 1 - Arrays

### Proposed steps to solve any problem

- Before writing code, let's thoroughly understand the problem and determine what needs to be done.
- Consider potential solutions and use pseudocode to jot down thoughts, helping to relieve our brain from excessive thinking.
- Write the code and verify the solution in your mind, going through each line step-by-step to ensure the code will work correctly and you understand its behavior perfectly.
- Run the tests.
- Look for any possible improvements in the code. If nothing stands out or you're unsure how to improve it, review how others have solved similar problems and try to understand and implement their approach.
